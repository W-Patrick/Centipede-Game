The player must shoot at the centipede and eliminate it before it reaches the player.
The centipede will split into two centipedes when shot and a mushroom will form at the point of impact.
Mushrooms have 4 health points and must be shot 4 times to disapear. They generally serve as an obstacle for the player.

This game was written mainly using recursive functions instead of loop functions.
